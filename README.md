Hreidmar is an alternative to well-known [Heimdall](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall). \
Written purely in C#. Uses [LibUsbDotNet](https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet) for communication. \
Here is an XDA thread about Thor: [click here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-thor-an-alternative-to-heimdall.4453437/).

It is completely cross-platform - Windows, Linux and Mac OS are all supported!

**Keep in mind, it is currently in development! I am looking for testers,** \
